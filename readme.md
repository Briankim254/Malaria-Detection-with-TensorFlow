# Malaria Detection with TensorFlow

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Malaria_Detection.ipynb) that implements a machine learning model for Malaria detection using TensorFlow.

## What is Malaria?

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects millions of people globally. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing severe illness and death.

Data is from Tensorflow Image library. A malaria dataset which contains approximately 27,500 cell images of parasitized and uninfected cells from thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.

## How this project works:

This project utilizes TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library, to build a model that can classify images as containing malaria parasites or not.

## What the Jupyter Notebook (Malaria_Detection.ipynb) covers:

1. Setting Up the Environment: This section guides you on installing the required libraries, including TensorFlow and any other dependencies.
2. Data Loading and Preprocessing: This section explains how to load the malaria image dataset and preprocess the images for model training. Preprocessing might involve resizing, normalization, or other techniques.
3. Model Building: This section details the architecture of the machine learning model. It will likely involve convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suitable for image classification.
4. Model Training: This section covers training the model on the prepared dataset. It will involve defining the optimizer, loss function, and training the model for a specific number of epochs.
5. Model Evaluation: This section explains how to evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and loss function.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:and F1-score might be used

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Briankim254/Malaria-Detection-with-TensorFlow.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

``` bash
cd Malaria-Detection-with-TensorFlow
```

Create a virtual environment (i recommend) to isolate project dependencies:

```Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # activate for windows/linux  or  venv\Scripts\activate.bat for windows
```

Install the required libraries:

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # assuming you have a requirements.txt file listing dependencies
```

Open Malaria_Detection.ipynb in your favorite Jupyter Notebook environment and run through the cells to train the model.


## Further Exploration

- This is a basic implementation. You can experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance.
- Explore transfer learning by using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet for feature extraction.
- Consider deploying the trained model as a web service to make it accessible for real-world malaria image classification tasks.
